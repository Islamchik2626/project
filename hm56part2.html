          <p>
            So, we know that relaxation is good for us, but how exactly? Check
            out some of the more excellent benefits of getting in some good zen
            time every day: <b>You'll keep your stress levels in check</b> .
            Stress in small amounts is okay – it motivates us to get stuff done.
            When it starts hanging around for a long time and affecting our
            everyday lives, it's time to take some steps to get it under
            control. Daily relaxation helps to manage stress levels.

            <b>Your mood will improve</b> . A great way to improve your mood is
            to give relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation. It
            involves relaxing the muscles, and it helps to get stress and
            anxiety under control. It takes practice, but it's worthwhile.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b> You'll sleep better</b>. Sleep is not only lots of fun, it also
            plays a really important role in making sure that we're functioning
            our best throughout the day. Find time to relax every night before
            bed and chances are you'll find your quality of sleep improves.

            >. Being stressed for long periods of time puts lots of stress on
            our bodies, especially on our hearts. Make it a habit to relax
            regularly now, and you'll be doing yourself a favour in the long

            CAN'T RELAX?
          </h1>
          For many people, daily relaxation is easier said than done. It can be
          hard to find the time, or you might find that even as you're trying to
          relax, your brain is racing through all of the different things you
          have to do. Like most things, relaxation takes practice, but if you're
          having a lot of trouble relaxing it's a good idea to have a chat about
          it to someone you trust like a parent, teacher or counsellor. If
          you're worried about it, make an appointment with your GP and together
          you can figure out a plan to get it under control.

              Stanley Park is a 405-hectare (1,001-acre) public park in British
              Columbia, Canada that makes up the northwestern half of
              Vancouver's Downtown Peninsula, surrounded by waters of Burrard
              Inlet and English Bay. The park borders the neighbourhoods of West
              End and Coal Harbour to its southeast, and is connected to the
              North Shore via the Lions Gate Bridge. The historic lighthouse on
              Brockton Point marks the park's easternmost point. While it is not
              the largest of its kind, Stanley Park is about one-fifth larger
              than New York City's 340-hectare (840-acre) Central Park and
              almost half the size of London's 960-hectare (2,360-acre) Richmond

              Provence is a historical region of France, occupying the
              southeastern part of the country. The very name Provence dates
              back to the era of the Roman conquest of Gaul. The Romans called
              the southern lands beyond the Alps in their possession "Provincia
              Nostra" – "our province", or simply "Provincia" – "province".
              Today, this historical territory is officially part of the
              Provence – Alpes – Côte d'Azur region, while the Provence
              districts themselves are administratively divided between six
              departments of the region.
